# Social Media App


Welcome to the README for the Twitter Clone project built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). This project aims to replicate the basic functionalities of Twitter, allowing users to post, interact, and engage with content in a simplified version of the popular social media platform.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB (Ensure it's running on the default port)

### Setup Instructions

The project is divided into two main parts: the frontend and the backend. You will need to set up both parts to run the application successfully.

#### Frontend Setup

To set up and run the frontend part of the project, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the `twitter-frontend` directory:
```bash
cd twitter-frontend
npm i
npm start
```

After running the above commands, the frontend should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

# Backend Setup
To set up and run the backend part of the project, follow these steps:

Open another terminal.
Navigate to the twitter-backend directory:

```bash
cd twitter-backend
npm i
node index.js
```

The backend server will start, and you should see a message indicating it is running and connected to MongoDB.

Usage
With both the frontend and backend running, you can now access the Twitter Clone application in your web browser at http://localhost:3000. You can create posts, view them, and interact with the application as intended.
